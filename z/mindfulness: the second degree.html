<h4>mindfulness: the second-degree</h4>
<p>My view of mindfulness, intended as a foil to <a href='./westernized buddhism: misconceptions about mindfulness.html'>common Western misconceptions</a>:</p>
<p>We tend to operate without being self-aware. That is, we experience the content of thoughts, sensations, and emotions as reality (unaware of the three-part structure of <a href="./content, commentary, and context.html">content, commentary, and context</a>). It's like when you're in a snowglobe, and it gets shaken: you think you're in a snowstorm, but really there's just a kid shaking it around. I call this being in the "first-degree" mode: you are not reflecting.</p>
<p>Alternately, we sometimes become so self-aware that thoughts keep feeding into each other in loops, which then stimulate behaviors, which stimulate more thoughts (a realization shared by cognitive behavioral therapy). In this version, you are shaking the snowglobe yourself. I call this being in the "third-degree" mode: that is, your reflection is building upon itself way too much.</p>
<p>Buddhism is very interested in the <span style="font-style:italic">middle way:</span> a state in which you go to neither extreme. Mindfulness is this, which I understand in the context of being a self-regulating system. You are able to stay within the frame, being able to watch the snowglobe without shaking it or getting trapped inside. This second-degree mode is the state to be in where emotions can be processed and regulated. It's a degree of removal that prevents thoughts from continuing.</p>
<p>This is also what's meant by <span class='italic'>metacognition</span>, in that we are able to self-regulate. However, compared to metacognition, mindfulness is wider: we apply it not only to thoughts, but also to our sense perceptions, feelings, and bodily sensations, realizing that all of these feed into thoughts as well.</p>
