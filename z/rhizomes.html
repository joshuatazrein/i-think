<p>Deleuze and Guattari's <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> is structured around this concept. Basically, it's grass (or a <span class='link' href='hypertext'>hypertext</span>). Anything for which any point can connect to any other point.</p>
<p>This contrasts what D+G call "arborescent" structures (another word for trees). These structures branch out from a common center like a genealogy or a hierarchy. Arborescence is the realm of taxonomies, categorization, and all-in-all Western-rational science. Rhizomes, on the other hand, are what we finds ourselves in currently: they are spaces of emergence, structured from the bottom-up, orderless, and traversible from any starting point.</p>
