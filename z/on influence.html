<p>In the words of André Breton, "Who am I? If this once I were to rely on a proverb, then perhaps everything would amount to knowing whom I 'haunt'" (although being a translation, this is rather the ghosts of his words). I have been haunted by a number of poets and other artists—especially those that believe themselves haunted. So a haunting of hauntings, as the people who preceded me discovered their own ghosts, in this discovery becoming ghosts of my own.</p>
<p>One important early ghost was Jack Spicer. A poet of the Berkeley Renaissance, Spicer believed his poems were dictated to him by Martians, and put up his radar one striking line at a time. His book "After Lorca" is a dialogue with the ghost of Federico García Lorca, supposed "translations" of the late great poet's work. Spicer's voice captures a strange sincerity and innocence, like a child staring into the depths of the roiling sea. I set some of these poems to music, and wrote letters to Spicer's ghost. So a "translation" of his "translations."</p>
<p>And translation, not just between languages, but between mediums—as my work frequently is a dialogue between sound and text, between semiotic and symbolic (to use the terms of French feminist Julia Kristeva, whose "révolution sur le langage poétique" provided me an insight into this dynamic). On this note, I'm intrigued by musicians such as Michel Chion, Beat Furrer, Helmut Lachenmann, Georges Aperghis, and others who extend and explore the voice's functionality. But I began with folk music, which got weirder and weirder, inspired by Joni Mitchell, Gabriel Kahane, and others blurring the lines between art song and folk.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been a language of parasitism inspired by philosopher Michel Serres and contemporary poet Sean Braune, a language which is not a self, but an infection of the self, perhaps the self infecting the non-self (or is it the other way around?). In this light, the work of Stéphane Mallarmé has come to mean a great deal to me—for its idealism and its purity which is itself an ideal of suspension, indeterminacy, and endless metaphor. The ghosts keep coming, and yet there is a deeper one that they all come back to, which isn't deep at all perhaps, the truth of surface. And yet everything is a network of influences here, acquiring depth from those connections.</p>
