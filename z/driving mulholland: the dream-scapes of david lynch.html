<p>David Lynch's iconic movie Mulholland Dr. begins with a car-crash on the eponymous street in Los Angeles, and ends in a surrealist dreamscape reassembling the wreckage of events which led to the crash. The street is the liminal space which pivots the film into its metaphysical dimension, the splitting line which is also the center of the movie's world. While waiting to leave the city of angels, I decided to drive the length of the street, winding for 30 minutes first up, then down, turning off the drive by accident and then making my way back to it. The street naturally lends itself to the kind of space Lynch's films create.</p>
<p>Lynch's power is unique among American filmmakers, and even among surrealists; while most Surrealists (capital s) were based in Paris, making their mythologies within the urban sprawl, Lynch creates a sub-urban surrealism: the once-removed city above the city, believing itself safe. And as in Blue Velvet, when a boy finds an ear in the lawn, his movies work to undermine the glitz of the dream, even as they immerse themselves in it.</p>
<p>Mulholland Dr. is a movie about the de(con)struction of an acrtress (that is, Betty): a murder mystery where the perpetrator is the protagonist, or perhaps the protagonist's waking self, suppressed initially by the dream. As the events in the movie recombine, we find ourselves winding back to Mulholland Dr., ascending to a party where Betty realizes her ideal, "Rita," has another lover. The movie traverses the city of LA, just as its characters are archetypes of LA.</p>
<p>And the male lover, the director, eventually finds his own reckoning on the winding streets: in his meeting with the Cowboy on an empty ranch high above the city. The Cowboy symbolizes a deity of sorts, like the disheveled man hiding behind the Winky's, or the short man in the wheelchairâ€”not-of-this-world lurkers, directors. The space holds them, just as it holds the structure of LA: the homeless people behind the Winky's, the affluent ranchers in their high ranches. Lynch takes these positions and converts them into metaphysical archetypes, his surrealism being layered on, and within, the space of the city.</p>
