<p>Baudrillard: the simulation is the copy without an original. But to put it more accurately, the simulation <em>erases</em> the original: it confirms itself as reality, overlaying and destroying the reality which was previously there; it enacts a "violence on the Real" (<em>Simulation and Simulacra</em>).</p>
<p>One example that would leave Baudrillard turning in his grave (and probably cackling in French nihilist "itoldyouso" fashion) is the Trumpean matrix. Trump managed to create a reality for his supporters where whatever he said was true, and thus he could effectively create whatever reality he wanted. This was a nuclear bomb on American politics, and is what it means to live in a "post-truth" society: Trump truly destroyed truth by making it impossible to point out his lies—if someone did, they were immediately the liar in the eyes of Trump and his supporters.</p>
<p>But the simulation has many guises, and Baudrillard's analysis of Disneyland is a particularly brilliant exposé. Disneyland creates a simulation of childhood so that adults can feel more adult: that is, they create a false fantasy of childhood which exists to confirm their status as grownups.</p>
<p>In this way, the simulation is a not-me, a simulated Other (another example: the Other of communism in the Cold War (just one in a chain in a long line of foreign devils which America simulates to keep its own border)). It is a construction which exists to keep the self alive. But the self is itself a simulation: a construct without an original, which is self-confirming or self-creating. The simulation is an ego, as in how <span class='link' href='systems theory: the maintenance of boundaries'>an organism necessarily maintains its boundaries</span>.</p>
<p>Buddhism (especially Zen) operates from a sophisticated and overarching theory of simulation: concepts themselves are simulations, and the ur-concept is that of selfhood. But <span class='link' href='westernized buddhism: misconceptions about mindfulness'>the West has also created (or appropriated) its own simulation of Buddhism</span>, which conforms to its own self-creation.</p>
