<h4>content, commentary, context</h4>
<p><ul>
	<li>Content: what you're trying to say</li>
	<li>Context: the space you're trying to say it in (the audience and by extension one's positionality within that space)</li>
	<li>Commentary: how we get between these two things</li>
</ul></p>
<p>This is a useful framing, I think, for how discourse works: (meta-)commentary is a necessary bridge between content and context. Because we all have our own idiolects (the language we use to articulate concepts), if I was to say the same thing to two different people, they would understand it in different ways. So an understanding of the other's frame is important when we want to be understood.</p>
<p>Commentary can take many forms: perhaps most commonly it is understood as sentence-starters ("I think/believe that..." "I disagree with...because..." etc.), but commentary can be everything from tone of voice to titles, headings, and citations. In fact, I believe that commentary is an integral part of the form of any piece of writing: the formatting of this blog post and my choice of words, for example, are governed by my desire to communicate a relatively personal yet searching tone (and whatever other insidious traps my ego has subconsciously set up for me).</p>
<p>Commentary is subtly meta- by nature: it is a way of acknowledging where we are and accounting for how we may be perceived. It is often the mode we engage in when revising text: considering the other's frame, and how our words are understood. At its core, commentary is how we establish our identities, in realizing the dance that identity is as we negotiate positionality.</p>
<p>In addition, commentary can be turned inwards: how to we understand ourselves? In this framing, the content of our thoughts emerges from the previous context of our ideas through a process of understanding them (that is, through commentary). This flips the traditional framing of content molded to context and instead becomes context molding/generating content (as exemplified by <a href="./on knowledge management, and the zettelkasten system.html">the Zettelkasten system</a>), which informs how I understand the self as inherently contextual.
