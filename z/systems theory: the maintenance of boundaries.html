<h4>systems theory: the maintenance of boundaries</h4>
<p>Systems theory was invented by German sociologist Nilkaus Luhmann (who also made <a href="./on knowledge management, and the zettelkasten system.html">the Zettelkasten system</a>) in the later 20th century, and its applications are wide and interdisciplinary. Systems theory defines what a system is in formal terms, provides criteria for different types of systems, and discusses which real-world things can be understood as systems.</p>
<p>Essentially, a system is defined in terms of its closure. Because it is closed, a system is self-generated, and thus emerges from making internal distinctions which increase its complexity (which Luhmann calls <span class="italic">unfolding the paradox</span>). A system must also maintain a boundary differentiating it from its environment, a property termed <span class="italic">autopoiesis</span>. Maintaining this boundary necessitates adapting to its environment via analogous structures, known as <span class='italic'>structural coupling</span>.</p>
<p>Systems theory suggests a paradigm where we understand systems (which include human persons) as selves which are fundamentally closed off from their environments, but because of their need to maintain this closure, integrated into it. It presents a way of understanding subjectivity without getting mired in psychoanalysis: the subject becomes a system which needs its environment to understand itself, often doing so with the aid of <a href='./the simulation.html'>simulations</a>.</p>
