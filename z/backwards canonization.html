<h2>backwards canonization</h2>
<p>Canonization is all wrong. The "Western Canon" is a <a href='./the simulation.html'>simulation</a> which creates a fictional origin point (such as the contrapuntal monkeys of Notre Dame) and reinforces it through educational reification and self-confirming familiarity bias. The error of canonization is its search for an ancient origin point, when in reality the influences just go back and back; if you wanted an origin point, try the Big Bang (but only because it's the limit of our puny knowledge-systems).</p>
<p>The canon is biased towards timelessness. In other words, it is biased towards death. And when contemporary classical composers need to compete for concert time with the likes of Bronze-Busted Beethovens, the canon is quite literally killing itself. It is resistant to change, resistant to growth, and resistant to the <a href='./westernized buddhism: misconceptions about mindfulness.html'>true state of perpetual change</a>. It is a lie.</p>
<p>In reality, the origin point is <strong>now.</strong> The present is the origin point, and <a href='./on influence.html'>influences</a> point backwards. We should teach the "canon" starting from the now, encouraging students to find what contemporary artists they like, and tracing their influences backwards. In this way, the canon becomes a <a href='./rhizome.html'>rhizome</a>, a series of points connected from a bottom-up structure. This reflects how the originally canonized works emerged anyway: through chance, association, connections, popularity.</p>
