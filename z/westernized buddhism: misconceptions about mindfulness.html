<h4>westernized buddhism: misconceptions about mindfulness</h4>
<p>I have been practicing meditation since I was 17, and although the word itself is held with a certain degree of distance by Buddhists, I call myself a Buddhist.</p>
<p>Buddhism is a religion which at its core is skeptical of identifying. One of its teachings which I have found most far-reaching is <span class="italic">anatta</span>, or non-self: the truth that the self is an illusion (keep in mind that this doens't mean the self doesn't "exist," but rather that it exists as an illusion). The attitude which emerges from this truth is a resistance to stories or accepting anything as absolute, and thus in order to truly be a Buddhist, one must question the coherence of the word Buddhism.</p>
<p>Thus the appropriation of mindfulness by the (capitalist) West is not necessarily a bad thing: while the concept did originate with Buddhism, I don't believe Buddhism would lay total claim to the word. In fact, the central ideas of mindfulness—self-awareness, skepticism of the truth of one's thoughts—show up in many areas of Western psychology and therapy (and Buddhism might even be considered a psychological system, as it has an established psychology as well as a skepticism for anything which is metaphysical in origin). However, the West (and this is true of most Western approprations) has taken mindfulness into its own Western ideology without recognizing its true nature. Ironically, this illustrates   <a href='./the simulation.html'>Buddhism's diagnosis of the self as a simulating force</a>.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is about the non-self: it is about dissolving the false conceptions of ourselves. It is not about "chilling out," "relaxing," or getting more "spiritual." In fact, most mindfulness practices are uncomfortable, grueling, and sometimes sublime: so it's not that these superficial words aren't necessarily compatible with mindfulness as nice side-effects, but they don't encompass what it is. I think the most grave misuse of mindfulness is as a timesaving tool—that meditation can maximize your efficiency and workplace productivity. Yes, it's good to pay attention—but "productivity" is a Western  obsession which is deeply ingrained in the individualism and selfishness characteristic of capitalism.</p>
<p>The West needs mindfulness—but it needs mindfulness in order to <span class='italic'>undo</span> its misconceptions about the self, not as another tool to cement them.
