  Fundamentally, posthumanism stems from a resistance to totality & the binarism of Cartesian (and European metaphysical) logic. Transhumanism is not a sub-branch of posthumanism but a hyper-humanism which intensifies the rationalist & teleological goals of human perfection through technology.

<h5>posthumanism</h5>
<ul>
  <li><span class='page'>xxxii</span> posthumanism has connections to Romantic thought a la Emerson (i.e. concealment of the world)</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xii</span> originated at the Macy converences on cybernetics, then was picked up by Luhmann and Hayles; Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" probably the best-known work</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xiii</span> now more thoughts tend to trend towards transhumanism (see posthumanism.com) <span class='page'>xi</span> </li>
  <li><span class='page'>xv</span> "<strong>[posthumanism] comes both before and after humanism</strong>": both reevaluating humanity as integrated, but also acknowledging the contemporary moment</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xvii</span> this doesn't mean that posthumanism can't dramatically inform disability theory and animality theory; in fact, it necessitates this <em>actual</em> justice</li>
</ul>
<h5>transformation of thought</h5>
<ul>
  <li><span class='page'>xvi</span> "the nature of thought itself must change if it is to be posthumanist" (see <span class='b-link'>Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism"</span>)</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xix</span> Luhmann: 'reality ... is what one does not perceive when one perceives it'</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xx-xxi</span> mysticism of humanism: "pluralism = monad" a la Deleuze & Guattari; Derrida's "openness from closure"</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xxiii</span> we can no longer talk about "a" body <span class='b-link'>Deleuze & Guattari, "How to Become a Body Without Organs"</span></li>
  <li><span class='page'>xxiv</span> first comes noise (Kristeva, Serres), then comes a subject</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xxxiv</span> noise, visuality, and sensoriums are deeply integrated into the network of this thought</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xxvi</span> for Derrida, language is the deepest prosthetic technology</li>
</ul>
<h5>critique of (trans)humanism</h5>
<ul>
  <li><span class='page'>xi</span> humanism = dignity and worth of all people</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xi</span> <a href="http://www.posthumanism.com">posthumanism.com</a> has a definition which most posthumanists would oppose; in fact that definition (and transhumanism more specifically) constitutes more a hyper-humanism</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xvi</span> transhuman has recourse to the anthropological universals of posthumanism</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xiv-xv</span> "the fundamental anthropolical dogma associated with humanism [is that] 'the human' is achieved by escaping or repressing not just [humanity's] animal origins in nature, the biological, and the evolutionary, but more generally by tenscending the bonds of materiality and embodiment altogether"</li>
  <li><span class='page'>xxi</span> Luhmann: "The history of European rationality can be described as the history of the dissolution of a rationality continuum that had connected the observer in the world with the world" (see Heidegger) <span class='page'>xvi</span> </li>
