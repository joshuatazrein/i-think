<h5>Frank O'Hara, "Today"</h5>
<p>
  O'Hara's work always brings me joy. His work, like his name, is frank—he says exactly what he means. This along with the documentary nature of the poem imbues his work with something I'd call animism, in that he doesn't need to dress up the world in order to celebrate it. Instead, he sees life in the small details. But this reading is of course too simplistic. With the use of "biers" and other morbid details, O'Hara also admits a darkness and irony to his poems.

<h5>Etel Adnan, "To Be In a Time of War"</h5>
<p>
  This presents a dissociated subject with the constant infinitives. I think the progression of infinitives in addition to their quotidian quality makes it seem like the war is neverending. It presents how alienated we are from war itself—and potentially that the true war is actually in living, or in pushing oneself to the next thing in the day.

<h5>Max Jacob, "Mystery of the Sky"</h5>
<p>
  One of the old men is about to speak when "the spell was broken": the speaker almost hallucinates the sky, imagining it will talk to him. Once this happens, it's almost as if some transgression occurs: the sky can only be a fantasy until someone creates sound. In this way the poem is about two surprises: one, when the sky begins to materialize, and two, when the mystery dissipates.
</p>
<h5>Frank O'Hara, "A True Account of Talking to the Sun at Fire Island"</h5>
<p>
  I love this poem. It's exciting in the way that O'Hara presents the sun with such irreverence. At the same time, the final stanza imbues such a quality of mysticism with the unanswered question of "Who are they" and the description of "Darkly he rose." This contrasts with the <a href='#mayakovsky'>Mayakovsky poem</a> it interfaces with, suggesting that the sun isn't quite as bright or great as Mayakovsky suggests. I think this poem is much more self-deprecating than the Mayakovsky. 
</p>
<h5 id='mayakovsky'>Mayakovsky, "An Extraordinary Adventure which Befell Vladimir Mayakovsky in a Summer Cottage!"</h5>
<p>
  This poem begins more angrily, with the sun almost burning Mayakovsky while it descends. Towards the end, though, the poet befriends and joins hands with the sun. This is an alternative take on inspiration, if the sun can be construed as a metaphor for it. O'Hara's sun is only a bit prickly, but when it leaves O'Hara with the poem the sun takes on a darker hue. Mayakovsky's sun is almost dangerous, but when it imbues the poet with inspiration he is all-powerful, having conquered the sun.

<h5>Hirschfield, "Poetry and the Constellation of Surprise"</h5>
<p>
  I don't really agree with Hirschfield's critique of scientific discoveries as being eventually old. This comes up a lot for me when poets use science as a dialogue for art; I feel they have an oversimplified view. Language has to progress in the same way science does; it's the reason we don't write sonnets the same was as Shakespeare did. The world changes, and we have to come up with new uses of language. Thus, the surprise in poetry is a permanent newness because it is another discovery of the uses of language—in the same way a scientific experiment might achieve. Poems are permanent contributions to poetry, new lingusitic experiments that build on the power of language. I don't think this should be reduced to one immanent reading or contrasted with science, because I see it as the same principle of building on what came before.

<h5>Ashbery, "A Blessing in Disguise"</h5>
<p>
  It's amazing the conversational tone Ashbery imbues his poetry with while the meanings are always escaping. In this way Ashbery does share an orientation with his friend Frank O'Hara, but while O'Hara's poems are very grounded in a version of reality, Ashbery creates his own realities. I'm struck especially by the line "That seem to shine at me though a lattice toward you": the speaker is skewered by the shining of the "real trees" which are on the way towards the other. In this way, the poem is about truth as much as longing for a person, as Ashbery's "you" seems to connote almost a pure pronoun rather than anyone in particular. 
</p>
<h5>Kim Addonzio, "The Shimmer"</h5>
<p>
  Addonzio is right in that surprise is a novel use of language. Poetry can wake up clichés. I think that this is both the essence of poetry and the essence of surprise (at least surprise which is embedded in language). Derrida talks about this in his essay "White Mythology": dictionary definitions are just metaphors which have been standardized. So the poetic is literally a lifting of language back into the realm of metaphor from where it has been calcified. Surprise is metaphor is poetry (imo).
</p>
<h5>Matthew Zapruder, "Dream Meaning"</h5>
<p>
  This is one of my favorite definitions of poetry. "The drifting, associating, linking experience that poetry creates is central to the way it makes meaning". To me, this justifies rhyme on a much deeper level than that it sounds nice or is pleasing. Rhyming is the linking and associating of words—which may only sound similar by chance, but which the mind still can draw an inherent parallel with. 
</p>
<h5>James Tate, "Rapture"</h5>
<p>
  Tate wakes up a cliché in this poem on multiple levels. In being enraptured by the blue antelopes, the woman is literally "raptured"—taken up into the sky or disappeared. In this way, Tate draws a parallel between surprise and the religious experience, embedding everything in a banal setting of a guy trying to get a girl. Perhaps there's a feminist reading here too, in that the "blue antelopes" are equated with the woman he's trying to get, and maybe they represent how men can never actually have women.
</p>
<h5>James Wright, "A Blessing"</h5>
<p>
  We gradually get deeper and deeper into the poet's meditation on death here—the end with the pony with skin "that is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist" suggests some sort of danger, perhaps self-harm. Then we arrive at the notion of "blossom", as the speaker wants to step out of their skin too. It's framed as a beautiful experience, but there's an element of death here in this vision. The other pony and the speaker's friend disappear too, which suggests the poet may have departed from them as well.
</p>
<h5>Terrence Hayes, "The Avocado" & "The Elegant Tongue"</h5>
<p>
  These poems are exciting in the power of their associativeness. Hayes is forcefully smashing and jumping, dealing with civil rights in one and eroticism in the other. His mind doesn't hold back in the depiction of these things, but also juxtaposes them with the most seeminlgy random things like an avocado, or an elephant. Hayes suggests that poetry can imbue significance into the seemingly random, showing that it isn't so random after all.
</p>
<h5>James Wright, "Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota" & Rainer Maria Rilke, "The Archaic Torso of Apollo"</h5>
<p>
  Wright's poem is totally arresting in the final image, like the Rilke poem. The two mentions of "your life" or "my life" bring a personal significance to everything that has come before them in the poems. We are invited to read a chicken hawk flying or a Greek bust as an abstraction of the speaker themselves, and so the poem teaches us not to take things at first sight. These poems are also arresting in their sledgehammer-like imposition of the speaker's psyche onto the poem; usually this is done much more subtly, but these poems are not.
</p>
<h5>Catherine barnett, "Origin Story"</h5>
<p>
  This poem achieves surprise through punning—Karl Marx and the poet's family name, throwing money and the idea of <i>Geworfenheit</i>. The poet brings an existential dimension into these things, illuminating a humorous take on high philosophical concepts that nevertheless brings these concepts into the speaker's own experience. 
</p>
<h5>Hirschfield, "Uncarryable Remainders: Poetry and Uncertainty"</h5>
<p>
  This is such an exciting piece. "Chaos is the progenitor of all other beings and things" is an amazing metaphysics. I'm reminded of Michel Serres' book "The Parasite," which suggests that static (such as radio static) is actually the generator of meaning, and not the inhibitor of it. In this way, poetry exploits the noise within the signal to enrich the signal itself: rather than trying to strip away any unwanted associations, it rejoices in the associative power of language to create something from the substance of that chaos. "What is goos poetry if not language awake to its own powers?" Beautiful.
</p>
<h5>C.D. Wright, "Animism" <span class='page'>88</span> </h5>
<p>
  This poem is complex, with an associative structure based on the "ark/dark" sonic pairing. C.D. Wright's poems are arresting in their agnosticism & play with sounds, & their ability to bring the two together. Words are concretized to foreground the ideological contemplation embedded in the poem, & thus the words contain a tension within themselves between conceptual signification & sonic meaning.
</p>
<h5>Duoduo, "Morning" <span class='page'>90-91</span></h5>
<p>
  The translation from the Chinese foregrounds one-syllable words with an emphasis on the word "dream". The repetition of "dream" is similar to the myth of "turtles all the way down" or a hall of mirrors in that each nested dream contradicts the one it surrounds with a deeper nesting. If you dream a dream, the dream that is dreamed is no longer a dream.<br>
  I enjoy the presence of the Chinese language in this translation; as each character in Chinese stands for one syllable I appreciate the poet's attention to using words that also consist primarily of one syllable.
</p>
<h5>João Cabral de Melo Neto, "The Emptiness of Man" <span class='page'>92-93</span>  </h5>
<p>
  This poem is a dyptich definition of emptiness with the first stanza contemplating the "fullness" of man and the second re-describing that fullness as a "sponge". This creates a paradoxical sensation of emptiness full of emptiness & expanding because of that. I wonder what it would mean to have a poetics of "holes", or non-meanings, or non-words? What would it mean for words to be as agnostic about their meanings as their subject?
</p>
<h5>Wallace Stevens, "Final Solliloquy of the Interior Paramour"</h5>
<p>
  Wow...this poem lights the world with a metaphyrics of imagination. The "high candle" is both one and God, but the stress in this poem is on the physical, the immanent. And so the manifestation of the "air" is also a manifestation of the mind of God, as the imagination is a force of creation which exists in both the inner and the outer. 
</p>
<h5>Paul Celan, "There was earth inside them"</h5>
<p>
  The poem digs until "the ring awakes": reinforcing both a ring of sound and a feeling of circularity ("der Ring"). I'm reminded also of German mythology, especially the Ring cycle here, although that may be too much abstraction. Celan is more interested in the descent rather than any cultural allusions, with a language grounded in the ground, the dirt, and the "them". The people have no relationship with God, and yet in this digging, when "the way lead[s] nowhere", they reach a sense of spirituality. 
</p>
<h5>Pablo Neruda, "The Enigmas"</h5>
<p>
  Neruda extends empathy to the nonhuman in this poem, which makes me think of a post-human poetry. Surrealism and questioning combine to suggest a negative capability which is the capability to reach beyond the human mindset and value system, a capability which suspends its rational judgement to accept the whole multifacetedness of the universe.
</p>
<h5>Antonya Nelson, "Stop Making Sense"</h5>
<p>
  It's interesting that the "surprise" Nelson suggests here is actually inevitable and prepared. Surprise has to be engineered to be so; and thus the "stop making sense" suggested in the title belies a deeper logic. Perhaps it's not "stop making sense" but, as I've said before on metaphor, making <i>new</i> sense. 
</p>
<h5>Inger Christensen, "Alphabet"</h5>
<p>
  The poem uses a Fibonacci sequence to begin (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) but soon departs from that. I'm curious to imagine what the rest of the poem is like—how long is the 26th? I love how this poem invents a world (the obsession with "exists") and how it delights in language. In this way, it imbues surprise into even the repetition of words, making them sound new and exciting with its emphatic tone.
</p>
<h5>John Ashbery, "And Ut Pictura Poesis Is Her Name"</h5>
<p>
  I'm stuck by the visual nature of this poem: Ashbery paints the poem just as he writes it. The allusion to Rousseau's jungle and the "extreme austerity of an almost empty mind / Colliding with the lush, Rousseau-like foliage of its desire to communicate" is an amazingly clear description: it's not metaphorical, it says exactly what it means. In this way, Ashbery's surprise is sometimes in his clarity: I find myself struck by some images which are stated in such purified language I can't help but see them. So there's a transparency to the poem, even if what it says is opaque.
</p>
<h5>Haryette Mullen, "Sleeping With the Dictionary"</h5>
<p>
  These poems create surprise (in some ways similar to the OULIPO) by their approach to the concreteness of words and by extension their use of constraint. In some ways I think the approach of constraint carries with it a natural surprise for the author: in wrestling with language, as in the process of revision, what comes out is the implication that the poet is discovering the meaning within the language itself. 
</p>
<h5>Rachel Richardson, "The Warmth of the Messy Page"</h5>
<p>
  I've tried to move away fron the idea of revision as separate from the first draft. Instead I view writing as a circular process of drafting, and the first draft just so happens to be the first vision. In this way I try not to write a perfect first draft so most of the time my poems are "overstuffed couches" and "lively messes". I also add a lot in revision and of course most of the language falls flat. I think most of the time I am actually trying to get a conceptual skeleton to emerge from the word barf, so the skeleton is embedded in the overstuffed draft waiting to be picked out.
</p>
<h5>Matthew Zapruder, "How To Write a Poem About Noguchi"</h5>
<p>
  I don't agree with all of Zapruder's aesthetics (in fact I think some of his advice works somewhat against surprise) but I do like the characterization of poetry as the meeting of a consciousness with the world. So it's neither a world in itself nor the account of a world, but an account of the bridge between the two. Perhaps this is where the surprise comes in (as in "the leap" in revision, where an idea coalesces again).
