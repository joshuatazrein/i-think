  <li tag='1'><span class='page'>2</span> generality is law: it establishes how "particulars" cannot be repeated or they would change</li>
  <li tag='2'><span class='page'>2</span> repetition works against law</li>

  <li tag='1'><span class='page'>11</span> indefinite comprehension: the assumption that something is a quasi-platonic form & extends completely over space; this then robs the concept of being ever matched in real life. This makes evaluation an evaluation of resemblances.</li>
  <li tag='6'><span class='page'>13</span> in order to have actual twins or doubles, this involves blocking the concept a la the uncanny, which disrupts laws</li>
  <li tag='7'><span class='page'>13</span> language is an inherent blockage of the concept (Lacan)</li>
  <li tag='1'><span class='page'>13</span> "real opposition is not a maximum of difference but a minimum of repetition"</li>
  <li tag='3'><span class='page'>15</span> understanding through repetition gives birth to knowledge</li>
  <li tag='6'><span class='page'>16</span> the uncanny: repetition is an expression of the death drive</li>
  <li tag='5'><span class='page'>17</span> "the death instinct may be understood in relation to masks and costumes": repetition is a mask, which is death</li>

  <li tag='1'><span class='page'>24</span> "repetition is difference without a concept"</li>
  <li tag='4'><span class='page'>24</span> the essence of repetition is self & other</li>
