  <li><span class='page'>187</span> what is literature?</li>
  <li><span class='page'>188</span> titles determine how we read a story, and bear the signature of the author <span class='page'>189</span> </li>
  <li><span class='page'>191</span> "what if the law, without being transfixed by literature, shared the conditions of its possibility with the literary object?"</li>
  <li><span class='page'>192</span> the "law of laws" is timeless, whereas stories are timeful</li>
  <li><span class='page'>193</span> freud; repression is based in abjection which leads to the law</li>
  <li><span class='page'>195</span> psychoanalyzing the guard as genitals of law</li>
  <li><span class='page'>196</span> "is it not its possibility and its impossibility, its readability and unreadability, its necessity and prohibition, and the questions of relation, of repetition and of history?"</li>
  <li><span class='page'>195</span> <b>country rat / city rat: connection to Serres: totemic meal</b> <span class='page'>198</span> </li>
  <li><span class='page'>198</span> the law is itself a fictive construct; it springs from fiction. Thus the fiction of fiction is the law of laws, similar to the uncanny representation of an absent father</li>
  <li><span class='page'>200</span> the law must shield itself from sight; "the story of prohibition is a prohibited story"</li>
  <li><span class='page'>200</span> <b>subject & object in opposition, "positioned" before the law</b></li>
  <li><span class='page'>201</span> Before the Law is torn from The Trial, another work: thus it doesn't stand on its own and the title was imbued after the fact</li>
  <li><span class='page'>203</span> diff√©rance: a promise granted but infinitely delayed (sort of like a striptease)</li>
  <li><span class='page'>205</span> "What is delayed forever till death is entry into the law itself, which is nothing other than that which dictates the delay"</li>
  <li><span class='page'>206</span> law as pure metaphysics & Heideggerian call of conscience; the law is also embedded in a sense of time</li>
  <li><span class='page'>207</span> literature begins with a state of not-knowing, the essence of fiction</li>
  <li><span class='page'>210</span> law as perpetual denial of jouissance / orgasm</li>
  <li><span class='page'>210</span> "The man comes to his end without reaching his end"</li>
  <li><span class='page'>213</span> literature is "the play of framing and the paradoxical logic of boundaries"</li>
  <li><span class='page'></span> </li>
  <li><span class='page'>214</span> literature is sustained by small doorkeepers which are deferred & confirmed by the invisible presupposition of the "great" law, the "essential" literary phenomenon; "Kafka's text tells us perhaps of the being-before-the-law of any text" <span class='page'>216</span> language beyond language</li>
  <li><span class='page'>220</span> experience is literary; the realist experience is surreal; we are all on trial</li>
