  Heidegger tries to restore metaphysics to its truest origin, which requires deconstructing it—ironically, this also suggests a more psychoanalytic orientation—or at least one grounded in "Beings" as such rather than a confirmed notion of objective "Being". Heidegger is not an anti-humanist; his goal is reparative, trying to "restore meaning" to the word 'humanism'.
