<h5>chapitre III</h5>
<p>
  Lawrence contemplates death, acknowledging that inauthenticity is "elle a horreur de sa vie, mas elle ne veut pas du tout mourir" (983). In contrast to this, they get into a car crash—and slightly before, Lawrence mentions that Jean-Charles always drives too fast. In parallel, there's a sense of the progression of history: feminism is faded, machines (which "ne changeront pas la nature humaine") (1101), and the feeling that humanism has been ruptured by the modern art. At the same time, Lawrence's relationship with Jean-Charles falls apart as he confessed he doesn't love her & accuses her of never loving anyone. This disgust for live is reflected previously in the meditation on suicide: "non le frêle cadavre accroché aux barreaux de la fenêtre, mais ce qui s'est passé dans ce cœur, juste avant" (990).
