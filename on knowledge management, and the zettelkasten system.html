										<h4>on knowledge management, and the zettelkasten system</h4>
										<p class="mb-30">My brain is a fish. That is, it only works in an environment. The Zettelkasten emerges from that principle: an effort to surround the mind with a web of ideas that it can swim through, leading to compounding insight. "Zettelkasten" just means "slip-box" in German; the notetaking technique was invented by sociologist Niklaus Luhmann in the 1950s to help with his research. Rather than taking notes in separate binders, he began filing them into a single box, each with an alphanumberic ID, and used these IDs to link them together and associate them. Luhmann was an intensely interdisciplinary thinker and eventually came up with Systems Theory, which has influenced disciplines as diverse as political science, biology, and information theory. He also was insanely prolific, writing over 400 articles and many books. Much of it was thanks to his Zettelkasten: when he needed to write an article, he would just pull the appropriate cards out of the box, following links and established orders to associate ideas. His insight was physicalized in the Zettelkasten: he was brilliant, but part of his brilliance was a cyborg.</p>
										<p class="mb-30">And with the Zettelkasten, Luhmann also managed to approximate the <a href='hypertext.html'>hypertext</a>, manifest in links between index cards. In the current day, the Zettelkasten has been translated into a slew of new apps, most notably Roam, Obsidian, and Evergreen Notes by Andy Matchusak. I have tried most of these programs, and they have their positives and negatives. The benefit of a Zettelkasten is the ability to freely associate ideas, but the drawbacks of programs based on networks is that they lose some of the top-level structure.</p>
										<p class="mb-30">The Zettelkasten works between two principles: the first is the filing system, which Luhmann called the Folgezettel. With Folgezettel, notes were sorted into hierarchical categories which branched further and further down like a tree. However, the links between notes interrupted that hierarchy, letting you jump between branches like a graph. This leads to the tree twisting in upon itself like a tangle, being filled with connections.</p>
										<p class="mb-30">To replicate this system, I've set up a Zettelkasten in Dynalist, which is an infinite outliner where each node can be nested into a branch, but linked to other nodes. I've found this format to be the most accurate replication of a Zettelkasten the way Luhmann did it, and the most flexible in terms of maintaining connections and growing the tree. Both a top-down and a bottom-up structure need to be balanced.</p>
