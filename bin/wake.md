# my poem

## poem
- each stanza as new day or another mode
- lowercase & medeival capitalization: proper nouns (unique or personified)
- Ringing / Difference: become more general
- center?
- & : less proper or formal
- indentation (rhythm)
- alliteration / sonically rich: 
- Wake capitalized @ the end

## thematic
- centricity of i & you
- not me / other
- recurring bowl / wall / crack / drip - waking in the same place
- i & its own perspective, everything is metaphor
- feeling
- **sparser capitalization**

## mood & atmosphere
- nonadherence to grammatical norms: moving time w/ certainties & uncertainties
- You is moving forward through everything
- primordial, internal, roiling
- doesn't really refer to external things (world is abstracted)
- turning external things inwards

## asterisks
- changes reading of poem
- process of waking once or multiple times , asterisks qualify it all as morning
- felt like multiple days after considering
- one waking but multiple wakings
- falling into the same patterns (capitalized words)
- **if some are more real than others (fake-waking?)**
- **longer pauses? how long are breaks between sections?**

## formal
- You character: romantic partner / other
- Spider: (God is coming)
- **lack of color & repeated use of endless walls / glass: feeling of endlessness & blurring: monotony**
- you are not me: recognition of the other within the self

## flow
- three drops from Therefore
- spider good
- falling good (extends endless: rhythmic)
- cold inhabits the bowl: more concrete
- some diction didn't match within stanza ( contrast to other language )
- images & diction: what do you bring in there?
- looking for a turn — when language shifts
- escalating sense of something being wrong / paralysis demons
- flamelike --> decomposed --> Oberlin buildings (not unfixable)
- degradation within images: I and you shifting
- **religious mystics; beloved & God fused**: check out the mystical religious poetry - Rumi etc. Longing for the divine
- Constellation three drops from your Therefore
- "isms": Godlike - coexistant
- **able to fuse the two together**: ordinary living details when the langauge is powerful
- **other times when language gets floaty & can't maintain the energy & urgency**
- Harbinger stis on Sill & has your face

- collated into copies around this bed: scripture one has made for oneself

up then down then up then down? more coalescing?
