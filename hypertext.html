	<h4>hypertext</h4>
</div>
<p>Text, context. Denotation, connotation. Reality, hyperreality.</p>
<p>Hypertext is the text of our age. It is the form in which most writing occurs: read through a screen, interactive, rhizomatic. We publish in blogs, Facebook and Twitter feeds (and thus <a href='content, commentary, and context.html'>content, commentary, and context</a> is formally embedded in the structure of a hypertext-as-dialogue); credibility is acheived through SEO ratings, determined by algorithms which sort us as a multiplicity.</p>
<p>This is in marked contrast with books, which attempt to close themselves in covers. The Internet is a system of pages, and not books, but <em>sites</em>: simply locations of aggregated pages, spaces of pages without a spine-bound order. The Internet implicitly acknowledges intertextuality: every website can freely refrence any other website, and it is through this system of references that we get the structure of texts (and the structure of knowledge, such as <a href='on knowledge management, and the zettelkasten system.html'>the Zettelkasten system</a>, which predates the hypertext).</p>
<p>Furthermore, hypertext is more than text: it is videos, photos, sounds, code, formatting—the text is activated, not just intertextual but also intermedia—adapting to the size of its container.</p>
<p>It is unlimited, and demands new ways of reading; the Derridean grammatology of paper books stemmed from the "text" being simply text—so what happens when the text ceases to be simply text, and becomes hypertext? Perhaps this multimodal reading was really what was going on all along?</p>
